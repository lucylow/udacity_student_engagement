Udacity can recommend an intro programming course as a prereq. In order to truly find out if there is a causation between two variables, we will need to run an A/B test. To make predictions with the data, machine learning and statistical inferences need to be added. For instance, given this data, can we predict which students are more likely to pass their first project? \n",

    "#### Future Questions \n",
    "* How do we improve user retention?\n",
    "* How do we improve user engagement? \n",
    "* How do we increase the number of students passing their projects?\n",
